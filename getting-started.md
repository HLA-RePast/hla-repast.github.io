# Getting Started

To run HLA_RePast, RTI needs first to be installed.  A list of different available implementations of RTI is provided [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_infrastructure_(simulation)). 
HLA_RePast was originally developed and tested using DMSO RTI-NG 1.3. This is now discontinued. 

The classic book [“Creating Computer Simulation Systems: An Introduction to the High Level Architecture”](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Kuhl-Creating-Computer-Simulation-Systems-An-Introduction-to-the-High-Level-Architecture/PGM62172.html) 
by Frederick Kuhl, Richard Weatherly, and Judith Dahmann provides an excellent starting point on building HLA simulations. 
Pitch Technologies (Pitch) provide a free tutorial [here](http://www.pitch.se/hlatutorial/).
